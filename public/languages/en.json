        "content": "<p>I have been passionate about development since my college days when my computer science teacher introduced me to <a href='https://scratch.mit.edu/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Scratch</a>, interest increased shortly after when I met <a href='https://code.org/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>code.org</a>. For a while, I immersed myself in block programming before getting into programming languages.</p>\n<p>I studied <strong>Computer Technology</strong>, there I met several development tools. Since then and due to the constant evolution of technology, I became self-taught. Currently, I try to put all my knowledge into practice, both in my work and in the projects I carry out.</p>\n<p>Because of my vision of creating solutions that improve the lives of others, I apply everything I learn in projects that I feel are practical not only for me, but for all the people who may come to visit them. But not all my life is programming, in my free time I like to exercise, share with my family, play videogames with my friends and strengthen my other passion,<strong> the music</strong> (I currently play guitar 🎸, piano in progress🎹.).</p>"
